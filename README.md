# Depression-detection-via-text
this project revolve on 4 experiment
1. Diffrent way of handling data text in preprocessing stage (stemming or non-stemming)
2. Comparation of text representation to depression text (tf-idf and MentalBERT as in  traditional and modern text representation)
3. ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) integration in Model to compare the improve of efficiency in the runtime of model.
4. Comparition of model performance between model CNN and MentalBERT(for classifier).

This Project using Dataset named "DREADDIT" which author is Elsbeth Turcan, Kathleen McKeown
